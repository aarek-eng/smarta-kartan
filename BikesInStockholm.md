**Second hand prices in Stockholm**  
Cheap second hand price for a normal bike (cykel) is around 1000-1500 SEK, and a few hundred more for a good lock, helmet and safety lights/reflectors. Fully functional cheap bikes occur in seasonal bike sales of leftover bikes from storage rooms, or in some bike repair shops, but in other cases cheap usually means they need some fixing. If you get a more expensive/good looking bike you may also need a really good lock or put ugly markings/tape on it to decrease risk of theft. 

**Cheapest buy option:**

Pay 100 kr membership fee, then fix up a bike with them and it’s yours\!  
The volunteers will help you with tools and instructions.

**Borrow a bike from Fritidsbanken for 14 days**  
This is a great start if you want to try biking in the city before investing in a bike. Fritidsbanken is a library of sports equipment, and borrowing from them is free for everyone   
Check out their inventory here (look for “Cykel”, and wheel size 26-28 inches).

The one in Sigtuna, Märsta has bikes for grownups. It is located a bit out of town, but very close to the commuter train station. When going to get it, remember that you can only bring a bike on the commuter train (pendeltåg) certain hours of the day\!
